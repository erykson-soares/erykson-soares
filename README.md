I am a Data Science academic and work as a law analyst in the legal market.

Currently, I work on the analysis and protocol of legal processes for the office's client portfolio and work on personal projects on Data Science, to gain experience in solving business problems and mastering data analysis tools.

I am looking for an opportunity to work professionally as a Data Scientist to improve the company's decision making, by building solutions using data.
